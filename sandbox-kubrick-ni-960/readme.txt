== ABOUT SANDBOX KUBRICK ==

The SANDBOX KUBRICK design was developed by ANDY SKELTON and built from the default WordPress theme, originally by Michael Heilemann, http://binarybonsai.com/wordpress/kubrick/.

ANDY: "Although I do consider myself style-blind, I did tackle the problem of creating the first complete Sandbox skin. Actually I dropped in the Kubrick stylesheet and tweaked it to work with Sandbox. It does a very nice job of emulating Kubrick – with a few improvements."


** VERY IMPORTANT **
=> To use a Sandbox theme template, the Sandbox theme must be installed.


== INSTALLING A THEME TEMPLATE ==

A theme template is installed just like any other WordPress theme.

	1. Extract the /sandbox-kubrick/ folder from the archive
	2. Upload this folder and its contents to the ../wp-content/themes/
		* The file structure should be: ../wp-content/themes/sandbox-kubrick/style.css
	3. The design will now appear in the Dashboard > Presentation menu

You can read more detailed installation instructions on the WordPress Codex.
